# COVID-19 Project <br>
## Description 
In this group project we like to find answers for these three questions.<br>
1. Which state(CA vs. NY) followed the Stay-At-Home order better?<br>
2. What if both states did not implement a Stay-At-Home or social distancing order?<br>
3. Does the Stay-At-Home order affect air pollution in these two states? If so, is it a positive or negative effect?<br>
<br>
