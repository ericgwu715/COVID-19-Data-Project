# COVID-19 Project <br>
In this group project we like to find answers for these three questions.<br>
1. Which state(CA vs. NY) followed the Stay-At-Home order better?<br>
2. What if both states did not implement a Stay-At-Home or social distancing order?<br>
3. Does the Stay-At-Home order affect air pollution in these two states? If so, is it a positive or negative effect?<br>
<br>
We will be using Python Pandas and Matplotlib to find the answers for our question.<br>
<br>

P.S. this is a reupload of group project. TEKM Team members: Eric Wu, Tan DuongKaren, Galindo Choudhary, Monte Rodriguez
