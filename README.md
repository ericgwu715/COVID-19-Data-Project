# COVID-19 Project 
<br> 
In this group project we want to know which state(CA vs. NY) followed the Stay-At-Home order better? What if both states did not implement a Stay-At-Home or social distancing order? Does the Stay-At-Home order affect air pollution in these two states? If so, is it a positive or negative effect?
