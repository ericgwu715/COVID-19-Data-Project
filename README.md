# COVID-19 Project <br>
In this group project we want to know which state(CA vs. NY) followed the Stay-At-Home order better?<br>
What if both states did not implement a Stay-At-Home or social distancing order?<br>
Does the Stay-At-Home order affect air pollution in these two states? If so, is it a positive or negative effect?<br>
<br>
We will be using Python Pandas and Matplotlib to find the answers for our question.
